# ðŸŒ· Flowershow template

> Publish your Obsidian notes (or any markdown), beautifully. For free, no coding.

Flowershow is an open-source tool for easily converting your markdown files into an elegant website. It's built on a standard, modern web stack â€“ React, Next.js, and Tailwind and shipped with a basic default theme to get you started with just a few clicks.

- **Crafted for Obsidian**, Flowershow works with your Obsidian vault out of the box. No need to modify the syntax or change the file layout. If you're not an Obsidian fan, Flowershow can be used with any CommonMark or GFM files.
- **Elegant and functional** default theme with basic front page and navbar.
- **Easy to tweak and extend** with custom page layouts and custom React components, that can be used within your markdown.
- **Backed by a team of data geeks**, who love Markdown, and are passionate about sharing knowledge and ideas with others.
