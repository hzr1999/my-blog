  The Western Marxist fixation on purity, staticity, homogeneity, etc. can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy (500 or so years BC) and the debates which would take place over the question of change. Here, two central poles of thinking about change, the Eleatic and the Heraclitan, would arise.

西方马克思主义在纯洁性，静止性，同质性等的固恋，可以追溯到古希腊哲学（公元前500年左右）和关于变化问题的辩论。在这里，两个思考关于变化的中心点，埃利亚学派和赫拉克利特学派将会出现。

  The Eleatic school, headed by Parmenides and defended and
developed by his most eminent disciples, Zeno and Melissus, held
that “befuddled and helpless, as to resemble the deaf and blind,” is
the person who sustains that “to be and not to be are the same and
not the same, and that everything is in a state of movement and
counter-movement.”[11] The two main principles of this school were
“being is one” and “being is unchanging.”[12] The ‘one’ here, however,
was not understood as a heterogeneous one, a one which contains
within itself the many – what Hegel and Marx would call the
concrete. It was, instead, a homogenous one. To hold on to a
dynamic many (to constantly interconnected plurality), was to
participate in the way of opinion, and hence, to be devoid of truth.
The appearance of contradiction, and the heterogeneity these imply
in things and processes, were seen as impossible.

  For instance, let us explore one (of four – according to Aristotle)
of Zeno’s paradoxes, where Eleatic thought reaches its most
advanced form. As Aristotle notes, “the first asserts the nonexistence
of motion on the ground that that which is in locomotion must arrive
at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal,” and since there
can be infinite divisibility, that is, infinite half-way stages, “it is,”
according to Zeno, “impossible for a thing to pass over or severally
to come in contact with infinite things in a finite time.”[13] For Zeno,
this contradiction inherent in motion made the existence of motion
impossible.

  While Zeno is correct about the contradictory character of
movement, “it does not follow,” as Hegel would note, “that therefore
there is no motion, but on the contrary, that motion is existent
contradiction itself.”[14] As the Polish Marxist Adam Schaff would later
argue, “when investigating the possibility of movement Zeno already
presumes that a body cannot ‘be’ or ‘find itself’ there otherwise than
by resting there,” his error, therefore, can be found in his “attempt to
‘reduce’ motion to a succession of states of rest.”[15] When Zeno
rightly arrives at the contradiction in the core of all change, instead of
accepting that contradiction as the “root of all movement and vitality,”
he withdraws investigation and considers his discovery a sign of the
falsehood of that which his discovery entails.[16]

  In contradistinction to this school was Heraclitus, who developed
a philosophy of universal flux, interconnection, and contradiction. For
Heraclitus, “everything flows and nothing abides; everything gives
way and nothing stays fixed.”[17] In Heraclitus it is also held that “all
things are one,” but this ‘one’ is not homogeneous and static, it is a
dynamic totality that is heterogeneous in character.[18] The many is
contained within the one, neither the many nor the one, as in the
Eleatics, is used to undermine the truth of the other. “In Heraclitus,”
as Hegel argues, “we see the perfection of the Idea into a totality,
which is the beginning of philosophy, since it expresses the essence
of the Idea, the Notion of the infinite, the potentially and actively
existent, as that which it is, i.e., as the unity of opposites.”[19] With
Heraclitus “the dialectic itself [is] principle” and “the first concrete”
category – becoming – arises and sublates the “abstract
understanding” of the Eleatics’ Being.[20] However, Heraclitus would
lose – at least until the arrival of Hegel and Marxism – the worldview
battle against Parmenides. Various aspects of Heraclitus’ thought
would become influential in scattered minds, but the anti-dialectical
ethos of Eleatic philosophy would remain at the heart of Western
thought for more than two millenniums. The Universal, truth, would
continue to be thought in terms of the unchanging, of that which is
devoid of relationality and movement, in short, in terms of what
Hegel calls the abstract understanding.

  Plato, as the next best dialectician of the ancient world, attempted
a reconciliation of Parmenides and Heraclitus. In the realm of Forms,
the Parmenidean philosophy of permanence would reign; in the
physical realm, the Heraclitan philosophy of flux would. In his
Phaedo, for instance, Plato would note that the realm of the physical
world is changing and composed of concrete opposites in an
interpenetrative, i.e., dialectical, relationship to one another. In the
realm of the “unchanging forms,” however, “essential opposites will
never… admit of generation into or out of one another.”[21] Truth,
ultimately, is in the realm of the Forms, where “purity, eternity,
immortality, and unchangeableness” reign.[22] Hence, although
attempting to provide a synthesis of Parmenides’ and Heraclitus’
philosophy of permanence and change, the philosophy of purity and
fixation found in Parmenides dominates Plato’s conception of the
realm of the really real, that is, the realm of Forms or Idea. As Hegel
puts it,

	This dialectic is, indeed, also a movement of thought, but
	it is really only necessary in an external way and for
	reflecting consciousness, in order to allow the universal, what
	is in and for itself, inalterable and immortal, to come forth.
	Hence [this dialectic], directed as [it is] towards the
	dissolution of the particular and thus to the production of the
	universal, [is] not yet dialectic in its true form: it is a dialectic
	which Plato has in common with the Sophists, who
	understood very well how to disintegrate the particular.[23]

  The disintegration of the particular expressed a dialectic which
was ontologically inferior to the Idea (realm of forms), where the
dialectic was null, and where homogeneity, disconnection, and
staticity reign. Plato’s dialectic, however, is itself multiple, and
appears in his large body of work in poorer and richer forms. For
instance, the Parmenides is where Plato’s most “genuine dialectic” is
“fully worked-out.”[24] Yet, the same distinction present in Phaedo,
another one of his middle works, is found here. In his conversation
with Zeno, Socrates says

	Tell me this: don’t you acknowledge that there is a form,
	itself by itself, of likeness, and another form, opposite to this,
	which is what unlike is? Don’t you and I and the other things
	we call ‘many’ get a share of those two entities? And don’t
	things that get a share of likeness come to be like in that way
	and to the extent that they get a share, whereas things that
	get a share of unlikeness come to be unlike, and things that
	get a share of both come to be both? And even if all things
	get a share of both, though they are opposites, and by
	partaking of them are both like and unlike themselves, what’s
	astonishing about that? … [But] if he could show that the
	kinds and forms themselves have in themselves these
	opposite properties, that would call for astonishment.[25]

  Again, the realm wherein truth does not delve allows for
contradiction, movement, interconnection; the realm wherein truth
does, that is, the realm of the essential Forms or Idea, does not.
Additionally, even in the realm where dialectics embryonically exists,
it is of a spurious character – it is a negative dialectic devoid of an
affirmative reconciliation into something higher. In other words, it is a
dialectic devoid of the negation of the negation. As Hegel says, “the
result arrived at in the Parmenides may not satisfy us, since it seems
to be negative in character, and not, as the negation of the negation,
expressive of true affirmation.”[26]

  Aristotle, a student of Plato, would move a step further away from
the Heraclitan philosophy of flux. In Aristotle we have the
development of the Western world’s first logical system, an
extremely impressive feat, but one composed of abstract and static
categories, completely indifferent to content and at odds with
categorial interpenetration. For Aristotle, the most certain of all
principles, of which there could be no demonstration for, is that “the
same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the
same subject and in the same respect.”[27] This is what is known as
the law of non-contradiction, out of which the law of identity (A is A)
and the law of the excluded middle (A is either A or not-A) develop
as well. The logic which organically follows from these laws of
thought is the logic (i.e., science of thinking) for what Hegel calls the
understanding, a form of thinking which foists disjunctions, staticity,
and abstract generalities onto the world. As Hegel says of the three
laws of thought (the heart of Aristotelean logic): these “are nothing
but the law[s] of abstract understanding.”[28]

  The fixation found in this logic would, of course, mirror the fixation
and purity with which the eidos (essence) of things would be treated.
Forms, although not existing in a separate realm as in Plato,
nonetheless exist with the same rigidity. The thinking of essences,
that is, the thinking of what makes a species, a type of thing, the type
of thing it is, would remain in the realm of science within this fixated
Aristotelian framework. Although the 16th century’s scientific
revolution begins to tear away the Aristotelianism which dominated
the prevalent scholastic philosophy, only with the publication of
Darwin’s On the Origin of Species would Aristotelian essentialism be
dealt a decisive blow. This essentialism, undeniably, is an
inheritance of the Parmenidean philosophy of permanence. These
limitations in dialectical thought, however, do not take away from the
fact that Aristotle was, as Hegel says, “one of the richest and
deepest of all the scientific geniuses that have as yet appeared – a
man who’s like no later age has ever produced.”[29]

  The philosophy of Plato, in the form of Neo-Platonists like
Plotinus and others, would be incredibly influential in the formation of
Christian thought – especially in Augustine of Hippo. Therefore,
when dialectics showed up, it was in the poorer forms found in
Plato’s dialectic. If we recall the critique of the negative dialectic in
Plato’s Parmenides we espoused above, “the Neo-Platonists, [like
the late Neo-Platonist Proclus],” Hegel would argue, “regard the
result arrived at in the Parmenides as the true theology, as the
revelation of all the mysteries of the divine essence.”[30] Christianity
would remain with a Platonic philosophical foundation up until the
12th-13th century’s rediscovery of Aristotle and the synthetization of
his philosophy with Christian doctrine via Thomas Aquinas.
Centuries later the protestant reformation’s rejection of
Aristotelianism would mark the return of Plato to the Christian scene.

  All in all, the Christian messianism which Manoel and Losurdo
see as the root of the fetishization of purity in every moment of its
unfolding presupposes a very particular line of Greek philosophy. It is
fair, then, to go beyond Christianity and ask the critical question:
what is presupposed here? What we find is that in every instance,
whether mediated through Plato or Aristotle, there is a Parmenidean
worldview which posits the homogeneous one, eternal and
unchanging as synonymous with truth, and the dynamic,
heterogeneous, and many as synonymous with false.
Nonetheless, what Hegel says with regards to Plato can be said
with regards to the Parmenidean worldview’s dominance in the
history of Western philosophy:

	Plato’s point of view is clearly defined and necessary, but
	it is impossible for us to remain there, or to go back to it; for
	Reason now makes higher demands … We must stand
	above Plato, i.e., we must acquaint ourselves with the needs
	of thoughtful minds in our own time, or rather we must
	ourselves experience these needs … [Platonic philosophy is
	a] moment which [has its] due place and [its] own
	importance, but [it is] not the philosophy of our time.[31]

  The Eleatic purity fetish worldview has been a necessary moment
in the development of what Hegel would call world spirit (weltgeist),
or what in the Marxist tradition we may call (with Ilyenkov) the Ideal.
The “reproduction of the concrete by way of thought,” as Marx notes
(along with Hegel), is “not a point of departure” but the result of “a
process of concentration.”[32] Abstract thought, as I have argued
before, is “a necessary moment in [the] ascension towards the
concrete reproduction of the concrete.”[33] However, as necessary a
moment (or moments) this dominance of the Eleatic abstract and
static worldview was, it was bound to be historically sublated by the
return of the Heraclitan worldview, but in the more concrete and
advanced forms in which it appears in the philosophy of Hegel and,
in an even more concrete form, in the Marxist dialectical materialist
worldview. While Heraclitus’s dialectical worldview suffered many
lost battles over two millenniums, it would come back with Hegel and
Marxism equipped to win the war. As Hegel rightly argues,

	If truth is abstract it must be untrue … [for] what is true is
	rather found in motion, in a process … the true is concrete,
	[and] must occur in the onward course of philosophical
	development. Philosophy is what is most antagonistic to
	abstraction, and it leads back to the concrete …it is the
	business of philosophy, as opposed to understanding, to
	show that the Truth or the Idea does not consist in empty
	generalities, but in a universal; and that is within itself the
	particular and the determined. It is just this unity of
	differences which is the concrete… [the concrete] is the
	union of the different determinations.[34]

  The spirit of the Heraclitan dialectic will be rekindled by G. W. F.
Hegel, who would argue that philosophy came to finally see “land”
with Heraclitus.[35] In his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel
says that “there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not
adopted in my Logic.”[36] It is in Heraclitus, Hegel argues, where we
“see the perfection of knowledge so far as it has gone;” for,
Heraclitus “understands the absolute as just this process of the
dialectic.”[37] Heraclitus’ dialectics understood, as Hegel notes, that
“being and non-being are abstractions devoid of truth, that the first
truth is to be found in becoming.”[38] This unity of pure being and
nothing is the starting point for Hegel’s Science of Logic. Here, he
argues:

	[Pure] being, the indeterminate immediate, is in fact
	nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing… Pure being
	and nothing are, therefore, the same. What is truth is neither
	being nor nothing, but that being – does not pass over but
	has passed over – into nothing, and nothing into being.[39]

Insofar as being exists in a condition of purity, it is
indistinguishable from nothingness. Being must take the risk of
facing and tarrying with its opposite in order to be. Being only takes
place within the impurity present in the oscillation from being and
nothing, that is, being only takes place when sublated into becoming
qua determinate being, as “coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be.”[40] In
fact, what Hegel shows is that, all along, this idea of ‘pure being’ was
not so pure – that is, when thoroughly examined, it already contained
within itself an identity with its opposite – nothing. An essential point
is made in this first movement in Hegel’s Logic, namely, the
determinateness of all categories is a result of tarrying with its
negative. As Hegel scholar Terry Pinkard argues, “the logic of other
more developed conceptions of being are constructed according to
the logic of the conception of pure being: each conception of being
takes its determinateness, as it were, from its own ‘nothing,’ from
what Hegel calls its negation.”[41] As Ian Hunt and Roy Swan
concisely put it, “the whole method is implicit … in the first triad of
Being.”[42] The seeming (Schein) desecration of a category when
confronted with its other is always the condition for the possibility of
escaping empty immediacy, of becoming determinate as mediated
immediacy, as a positive which has been mediated – and hence, is
conscious of it containing within itself – the negative.

This is why, in his Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel says that
“Substance is being which is in truth Subject.”[43] Substance (in
Greek ousia and Latin substantia), whose foundational purity holds
the crowning jewel of Truth for Western philosophy, can be only
insofar as it is “self-othering” itself.[44] Far from being in a unilateral
relationship of necessity with subject, with subject existing qua
determined by substance, this relation is reciprocal – substance can
only be as substance in so far as it is through subject. In substance
as in subject, the negative is contained as an indispensable
component of the conceptual identity of each. Substance must, as
Hegel argues, look the “negative in the face, and tarry with it.”[45]
When it does this, it finds that its conceptual identity contains, “not
externally, but in its own self, in its very nature,” difference (i.e.,
impurity, the negative).[46] Only insofar as something can self-
otherize itself, which is to say, only insofar as a thing can immanently
provide a negation for itself and desecrate its purity by wrestling with
the impure, can conditions for the possibility of it being actual arise.
Hence, the “truth of being” is “characterized as Becoming;” truth is
won “only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds itself.”[47] This is
true regardless of the different forms of mediation that negation
takes in the logic of being (transition), the logic of essence
(reflection), and the logic of notion (development).

Purity, the “[shrinking] from death [to] keep untouched by
devastation,” is lifeless.[48] Jay cannot be with Daisy insofar as he
wishes to retain the relationship in purity. Western Marxists will never
build socialism, or find a socialism to support, insofar as they expect
socialism or the working class to arise in the pure forms in which it
exists in their heads.
Now that the philosophical ground of Western Marxism’s purity
fetish has been developed and shown to be rooted in a very
particular line of Greek philosophy (and only indirectly in Christian
mysticism), let us turn to the variety of ways this outlook manifests
itself in Western Marxism.
